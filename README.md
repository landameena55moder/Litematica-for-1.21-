This extension adds printing functionality for [Litematica fabric](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica). Printer
allows players to build big structures more quickly by automatically placing the correct blocks around you.

## Installation 
1. Download and install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) if you haven't already.
2. [Download]() the latest Litematica Printer release for your Minecraft version from the releases.
3. Place the downloaded .jar files in your `mods/` folder.

## How to use
The default hotkey to open the in-game config GUI is M + C. If you are for example on AZERTY keyboard layout instead, then the keys are different, and M + C becomes, + C instead, etc.

Note: If you have Fabric installed, then there are some options that you most likely will need to disable in Fabric, or otherwise it will break the schematic rendering:

    - Render Regions needs to be disabled
    - Shaders need to be set to OFF, or alternatively disable VBOs in the vanilla Video settings, and disable both the ‘schematicOverlayModelOutline‘ and ‘schematicOverlayModelSides‘ options in the Visuals category
    - Fast Render might also need to disable if there is still some weird HUD/GUI rendering issues
